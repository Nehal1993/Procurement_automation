Demand forecasting on the basis of recent sales record. 
User will be asked to upload sales record in Csv format. Also code will ask 'TYpe', In that you can enter EW or Spare.
Sample sales record file is also availabe in repository
The code will perform necessary data cleaning and will apply ARIMA model to predict demand of each product
In the end code will return Csv file with and addtional column of forecasted demand.
For this project scope it was estimated that lead time ( based on Past experience ) is roughly 4 months.
So, demand for next 4 month is estimated.
